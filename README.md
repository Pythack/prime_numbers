# prime_numbers
A program that calculate the prime numbers. 
Download all the files, and place them all in one folder. The programm will calculate the prime numbers with the previously 
calculated prime numbers. It will restart at the same number he finished with. 
All programm by me, except the modules. 

The test.py programm can test individually a number, and tells you if it is a prime number.
